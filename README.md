# blockchain_ledger_system


This assignment took base code of the pychain system and added upon it to create a blockchain like ledger that stores user inputs as the block data. Three classes were used Record, Block and Pychain. Record was used to collect user data, Block was used to store the user data into a block like format and finally Pychain was used to connect the current block to the previous one by including the previous hash.
