In this activity object oriented programing was used to replicate a basic blockchain system. First class called record was created to store user data like sender, reciver and amount to transfer. Then this data was fed into another class called block that takes the data and orients it into a block format so that the final class Pychain can add it to the chain of blocks we have created. The chain is connected though the block hashes with each current block having the hash of the previous block included within it.
